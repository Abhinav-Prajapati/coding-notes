# Functional C++ Crash Course

Author: methylDragon  
Contains a syntax reference for C++  
This time, we'll be going through Functions and File I/O!   
I'll be adapting it from the ever amazing Derek Banas: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rub-JsjMhWY

------

## Pre-Requisites

### Assumed knowledge (This is a C++ crash course, not a basic coding tutorial)

- How **variables, loops, conditionals, etc**. work (Basic coding fundamentals will help a lot!)
- Linux (**Terminal/Console proficiency**) (We're going to need to compile our stuff)
- Gone through the all preceding parts of the tutorial

## 1. Introduction <a name="1"></a>

We've gone through the basics of C++. Now let's throw in some functions and file interactions!



## 2. Functional C++ Syntax Reference <a name="2"></a>

### 2.1 Functions <a name="2.1"></a>

[go to top](#top)

Declare your functions **BEFORE** the main function!

`int addNumbers(int firstNum, int secondNum = 0)`
firstNum and secondNum are attributes. We set secondNum's default value if no value is given to be 0.

int on the addNumbers function prototype is the RETURN datatype, in other words, the data type of the function's output.

```c++
int addNumbers(int firstNum, int secondNum = 0) {
	int combinedValue = firstNum + secondNum;
	
	return combinedValue;
	
}
```

!! NOTE. combinedValue is not accessible anywhere else other than in addNumbers, as it is a **LOCAL** variable defined WITHIN a function.



### 2.2 Function Overloading <a name="2.2"></a>

[go to top](#top)

> C++ allows specification of more than one function of the same name in the same scope. These are called overloaded functions and are described in detail in Overloading. Overloaded functions enable programmers to supply different semantics for a function, depending on the types and number of arguments.

> For example, a print function that takes a string (or char *) argument performs very different tasks than one that takes an argument of type double. Overloading permits uniform naming and prevents programmers from having to invent names such as print_sz or print_d. The following table shows what parts of a function declaration C++ uses to differentiate between groups of functions with the same name in the same scope. - Microsoft

```c++
void sameFunction(int a){
  // do stuff;
}

int sameFunction(float a){
  // do something else;
}

void sameFunction(int a, float b){
  // do something different;
}
```

Functions can have the same name, but do DIFFERENT THINGS depending on what gets passed to them!



### 2.3 Recursive Functions <a name="2.3"></a>

[go to top](#top)

These are functions that call THEMSELVES. Trippy.

```c++
int getFactorial(int number){
	int sum;
	if(number == 1) sum = 1; //Yeah you can do this
	else sum = getFactorial(number - 1) * number;
	return sum;
)
```

This function returns the factorial of itself, and it keeps calling itself which results in it calling itself until it stops, then it resolves one by one till all are resolved.

The last function calls to go on the stack are resolved first! USE THE STACK! Play some Magic!



### 2.4 File I/O <a name="2.4"></a>

[go to top](#top)

File input output.

Remember to `#include <string>` and `#include <fstream>`

```c++
string dragonQuote = "Rawr. But I can talk. Sup."; // Define the string to be written

ofstream writer("dragonQuote.txt");  //Open a .txt file called dragonQuote, this is an OUTPUT filestream

if(! writer) { //Check to see if the filestream is open

	cout << "Error opening file" << endl;
	return -1; // Return -1 if failed

	)	else {

	writer << dragonQuote << endl; // Write dragonQuote to writer, which causes dragonQuote.txt to contain only dragonQuote 
	writer.close(); // Close the file

	}
}

ofstream writer2("dragonQuote.txt", ios::app); //Create a writer object that appends to dragonQuote.txt

// Open a stream to append to what's there with ios::app
// ios::binary : Treat the file as binary
// ios::in : Open a file to read input
// ios::trunc : Default
// ios::out : Open a file to write output

if(! writer2) { //Check to see if the filestream is open

	cout << "Error opening file" << endl;
	return -1; // Return -1 if failed

	)	else {

	writer2 << "\n -methylDragon" << endl; // Append  "\n -methylDragon" 
	writer2.close(); // Close the file

	}
	
	char letter;
	
	ifstream reader("dragonQuote.txt"); // Open an input filestream that reads dragonQuote.txt
	
	if(! reader){
		
		cout << "Error opening file" << endl;
		return -1;
		
	} else {
		
		for(int i = 0; ! reader.eof(); i++){ // Read until end of file
		
		reader.get(letter); // Get the next letter 
		cout << letter; // And print it
	
	}
	
	cout << endl;
	reader.close();
}
```



```
                            .     .
                         .  |\-^-/|  .    
                        /| } O.=.O { |\     
```
