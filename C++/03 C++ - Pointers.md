## 1. Introduction <a name="1"></a>

Ok. So we've covered the basics of C++ that overlap with most other programming languages. Now we'll dive into the deep end of what makes C++, well, C++. Memory management, pointers, and the like.

### 2.1 Memory Addresses <a name="2.1"></a>

[go to top](#top)

https://gist.github.com/ericandrewlewis/720c374c29bbafadedc9

Basic understanding: Whenever you create a variable, say...

```c++
int myNumber = 8;
```

The variable, myNumber is another name for a **memory address** that **stores** the value 8. Every variable does this. (Example memory address: 0x1001054a0)

>  Imagine that the memory address is a box that holds the value! The variable name then is a user-friendly way to give the box a name to refer to it (instead of having to type out the memory address explicitly!)

We use these variable names to manipulate the values stored within their respective **memory addresses**.

In order to print out the memory address of a variable, use the **reference** ('address-of') operator (&)

```c++
std::cout << "The variable's value lives at memory address " << &myVariable << "\n"; // This prints out the memory address of myVariable
```



### 2.2 Passing by Value vs Passing by Reference <a name="2.2"></a>

[go to top](#top)

https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/2gl0xh/eli5programming_value_vs_reference/

This leads us to a very **important** concept in C and C++. The difference between passing by **value** and passing by **reference**.

Let's illustrate the important difference between the two using an example.

```c++
void myMultiplicationFunction(int x) 
{
  x = x * 2;
}

int main()
{
	int x = 2;
	myMultiplicationFunction(x);
  	std::cout << "Multiplied x is " << myMultiplicationFunction(x) << '\n';
	std::cout << "x is " << x;
}

/* OUTPUT:
Multiplied x is 4
x is 2
*/
```

This is **very weird**. Didn't the function manipulate x, since we passed it?

Well, actually, not really. The key understanding is that there are **TWO** ways to pass variables to functions.

> Passing by **Value**: You pass a COPY of the value stored inside a variable
>
> - This means the original value stored in the variable **DOESN'T CHANGE**

> Passing by **Reference**: You pass the variable itself! (By passing the reference TO the variable)

> - This is the **only way to change** the value stored in a variable!

The default way C++ passes variables to functions when you write them as arguments is through passing by **value**!

So **how** do we pass by reference? You can do it in two ways. Either:

>a) Access the value via **pointers**
>
>b) Set the argument to be the variable itself via **references**

The concepts needed to understand them will be explained in the next section

```c++
// Via pointers (a)
void myMultiplicationFunction(int *x) // Pass this function addresses (&parameter)
{
  *x = x * 2;
}

// Example call: 
// int a = 2;
// myMultiplicationFunction(&a);

// Via references (b)
void myMultiplicationFunction(int &x) // Pass this function variables! (parameter) it'll find the address itself!
{
  x = x * 2;
}

// Example call: 
// int a = 2;
// myMultiplicationFunction(a);
```



### 2.3 References <a name="2.3"></a>

[go to top](#top)

**Recall:** Every variable that you define is another name (an **alias**) of a memory address. Imagine these memory addresses as boxes to store values in, and the variable names as a way to refer to the box.

You can create MORE **aliases** for the variables! These are called **references**.

```c++
// Let's say we have a variable defined
int i = 5;

// To define an alias (r) for it, we use
int &r = i; // Now, manipulating r, does the same thing as manipulating i
// Note: int& r = i; will ALSO work!

// What we're essentially saying, is, let the address of r (&r)  be the same as the address defined by i. So now r and i refer to the SAME memory address.
// r does NOT STORE the memory address, r BECOMES another name for the memory address that i is the alias for
```

To illustrate what we've just done, examine the output of the following program:

```c++
cout << "r = " << r << endl;
cout << "i = " << i << endl;
r++;
cout << "i = " << i << endl;

/* OUTPUT:
r = 5
i = 5
i = 6
*/

// Notice how i changed even though we didn't explicitly manipulate i, but r instead? r is indeed an alias for i!
```

**Note that there are some restrictions on references though!:**

> - References cannot be NULL (they must always be an alias for something that exists)
> - References cannot be changed to be an alias for another object/variable
> - A reference must be initialised when it is created



### 2.4 Pointers <a name="2.4"></a>

[go to top](#top)

Pointers are **variables** in and of themselves, that **STORE MEMORY ADDRESSES**. In effect, they act as signposts that POINT to memory addresses!

> A pointer `x` that points to variable `y` will have its own memory address, but will store the memory address that y is the alias for.

Pointers are the more versatile, but less 'safe/secure' cousin to references.

```c++
// You define a pointer by using the * operator
int myNumber = 5;
int* myPointer = &myNumber; // Now myPointer stores the memory address of myNumber, which is an int
// Note: int *myPointer = &myNumber; will ALSO work!
```

Now we can manipulate and access this variable! We access the data stored inside the memory address pointed to by the pointer using the **dereference** operator (*)

```c++
cout << "Address of pointer: " << myPointer << endl;
// To access the data stored inside the memory address pointed to by the pointer, use the asterisk again. But this time it's used as a 'dereferencing operator'
cout << "Number stored: " << *myPointer << endl;

/* OUTPUTS:
<some address>
5
*/
```

Final intuitions:

References are the ALTERNATE NAMES you give to memory addresses. When you increment a reference, you are incrementing the value contained within the memory address!

Pointers STORE the memory addresses. When you increment a pointer, you are incrementing the memory address (the label), not the value contained within it!

### 2.5 Arrays with Pointers <a name="2.5"></a>

[go to top](#top)

Basic concept: When an array is initialised in C++, each successive array element is actually in successive memory addresses! So when you increment a pointer that points to an array, you'll change the value that is pointed to to the next element!

```c++
// Let's try this out!
int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // Initialise an array
int* numbersPtr = numbers; // And a pointer!

cout << "Before: " << *numbersPtr << endl;

numbersPtr++; // We increment the pointer here

cout << "After: " << *numbersPtr << endl;

/* OUTPUTS:
Before: 1
After: 2
*/
```

The variable name of an array is also just a pointer to the array!

```c++
// Let's try this out!
int numbers[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}; // Initialise an array

cout << "Before: " << *numbers << endl;

numbersPtr++; // We increment the pointer here

cout << "After: " << *numbers << endl;

/* OUTPUTS:
Before: 1
After: 2
*/
```

> So because of this. Just remember that array variables are special, since they're not really variables (aliases), but pointers that point to the array. So passing arrays to functions will result in you passing by reference!



### 2.6 Indirection (Pointers of Pointers) <a name="2.6"></a>

[go to top](#top)

Basically, pointers to pointers (ad nauseum)

If you think of a first-level pointer (say... int*) as an array, then a second-level pointer (int**) is an array of arrays! The cool thing about doing nth-dimensional arrays via pointers, is that the sizes don't have to be set in stone for the lowest level array!

```c++
// Here's an example

int numbers[5][5]; // This will give you 25 memory blocks worth of data. 5 arrays of size 5
int* numbers[5]; // This will give you n * 5 memory blocks worth of data, where n is the size of the particular array being pointed at

// You can do this ad nauseum, creating monstrosities like int************
```

Why is this useful? Let's ask stackoverflow!

Another example of indirection being used, is with strings!

### 2.7 When to use Pointers and when to use References <a name="2.7"></a>

[go to top](#top)

General maxim: `Use reference wherever you can, pointers wherever you must.`

Use pointers if you don't want to initialise it at point of declaration. (Declaring an object means you create it. Initialise means you assign a value to it as well as creating it.) 

You HAVE to initialise a reference when you create it because a reference cannot be an alias for nothing/NULL, but pointers CAN!!

Pointers can also be altered to point to other memory addresses! But references are stuck with being an immutable alias for only ONE object!



```
                            .     .
                         .  |\-^-/|  .    
                        /| } O.=.O { |\     
```
