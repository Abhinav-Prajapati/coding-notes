# OOP Python 3 Crash Course

Author: methylDragon  
Contains an advanced syntax reference for Python 3  
This time, we'll be going through many many (mostly unrelated) Python 3 coding concepts!  
I'll be adapting it from the ever amazing Derek Banas: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4mEzFDjqtA

## Pre-Requisites

### Assumed knowledge 

- Gone through the all preceding parts of the tutorial


### Good to know

- We're using Python 3 here! Python 2 has different syntax!
- If you have knowledge of computation structures like variables, functions, OOP, etc. it'll be easier
- But if not... https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGLfVvz_LVvTn3cK5e6LjhgGiSeVlIRwt
  - Or you can learn on the go!

## 1. Introduction <a name="1"></a>

Ok. We've gone through all the basic stuff and simple syntax.

Now let's dive into the deep end. Very little hand holding here, but lots of useful concepts, and some pretty powerful stuff! 

> I can't find a way to organise these, so just look through what looks interesting. I'll try to write pre-requisite concepts so you can have things to Google or refer to, but we're going to go pretty fast.
